**Description of the problem**

- Function that determines if number is prime.
- Use this function in a program that determines
and prints all the prime numbers between 1 and 10000.How many of these 10000 numbers do you
really have to test before being sure you have found all the primes?
- Initially you might think that n/2 is the upper limimit for which you must test to see if a number
is prime,but you need only go as high as the square root of n.Why?Rewrite the program,and run it both
ways.Estimate the perfomance improvement.
