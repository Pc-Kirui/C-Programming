**Objectives**

- To be able to use the functions of the character handling library(ctype).
- To be able to use the string character and character input/output functions of the standard input/output library(stdio).
- To be able to use the conversion functions of the general utilities library(stdlib).
- To be able to use the string processing functions of the string handling library(string).
- To appreciate the power of function libraries as a means of achieving software reusability.

**Introduction**

C standard library functions facilitate string and character processing.The functions enable programs to process characters,strings,lines of text and blocks of memory.
Techniques used to develop editors,word processors,page layout software,computerised typesetting systems and other kinds of text processing software are discussed.
